This repository contains search plugins for the search feature in [qBittorrent](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent).

:warning: We removed support for Python 2. Please, upgrade to Python 3 to continue using the search function.

Jackett search plugin is enabled by default but you have to install an external program to make it work. You can disable the Jackett search plugin or [install Jackett](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/How-to-configure-Jackett-plugin).
